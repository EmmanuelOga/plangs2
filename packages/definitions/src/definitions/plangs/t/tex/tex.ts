      description:
        "TeX (/t…õx/, see below), stylized within the system as TeX, is a typesetting program which was designed and written by computer scientist and Stanford University professor Donald Knuth and first released in 1978. The term now refers to the system of extensions - which includes software programs called TeX engines, sets of TeX macros, and packages which provide extra typesetting functionality - built around the original TeX language. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems.",
