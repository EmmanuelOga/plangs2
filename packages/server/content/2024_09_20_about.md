Plangs is a website dedicated to aggregating and curating information about a wide variety of programming languages.

## Community Contributions {#contrib}

The initial data for Plangs was seeded from Wikipedia. While Wikipedia offers a rich repository of information, not all programming languages have dedicated pages! We gladly accept contributions from the community.

## Static Website and Baked Data {#static}

Plangs is built as a static website. All the data on our site is available as a [JSON file](/plangs.json), inspired by [Simon Willison's Baked Data Pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/).
