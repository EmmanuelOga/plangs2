Plangs is a website dedicated to aggregating and curating information about a wide variety of programming languages.

## Community Contribution

The initial data for Plangs was scraped from Wikipedia infoboxes on programming languages. While Wikipedia offers a rich repository of information, not all programming languages have dedicated pages!

We manually update the entries for each programming language and tool and gladly accept contributions from the community.

If you find any mistakes or want to submit new information, please feel free to open a pull request on our GitHub repository.

## Static Website and Baked Data

Plangs is built as a static website. All the data on our site is available as a JSON file, following the "baked data" pattern inspired by [Simon Willison's Baked Data Pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/).
