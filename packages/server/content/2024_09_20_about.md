**Plangs** is a curated resource for exploring programming languages and tools. Our goal is to provide a practical, production-ready relection of languages and resources, helping you find what’s worth using today.  

## What’s Included  

Plangs focuses on languages that are ready for real-world projects—or close to it. While experimental or alpha-stage languages may appear, they must at least support prototyping, and have good documentation. The community ultimately shapes what gets featured, so discussions and contributions are welcome!  

## Community Contributions  

Plangs started with a mix of Wikipedia data, AI prompts, [Github](https://github.com/tjpalmer/languish) and [Languish](https://github.com/tjpalmer/languish) data, and manual curation. Contributions from developers are always appreciated!  

## Built for Simplicity  

Plangs is a static website. All site data is available as a [JSON file](/plangs.json), inspired by [Simon Willison’s Baked Data Pattern](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/).
