Plangs uses [Languish](https://github.com/tjpalmer/languish) data for programming language rankings. Languish bases its rankings on data from GitHub and Stack Overflow, producing a simple average score that allows ranking languages for popularity. The rankings are typically updated quarterly. Plangs! just picked up data for the last quarter of 2024 from Languish.

Apropos of Languish, its author, TJ Palmer, runs a fantastic YouTube channel and community ((comm+contextfree)) discussing all things programming languages. In his latest video, Programming Languages in 2024!, Plangs gets a feature! Itâ€™s packed with insights, so you should definitely check it out.
