To me, it's exciting to dive into different programming languages and uncover their unique features. Each language brings a fresh perspective and a new set of tools to solve problems in innovative ways.

But programming languages aren't just standalone entities; they create entire ecosystems filled with linters, formatters, libraries, frameworks, and many other tools that make development better and more enjoyable. Plangs mission is to provide a one-stop resource not only for languages but also for their tooling and overall ecosystem.

I initially seeded Plangs information with data from Wikipedia about several well-known languages. However, Wikipedia's notability criteria can be limiting. This means many innovative languages and tools might not be featured there. If you know of or are working on a programming language that's almost ready for a community to use, or a tool that's not yet listed, we encourage you to open a pull request!

## Thank you for visiting Plangs!
