It's exciting to dive into different programming languages and uncover their unique features! Each language brings a fresh perspective and a new set of tools to solve problems in innovative ways.

But programming languages do not stand standalone... they usually bring an entire ecosystems of tools like linters, formatters, libraries, frameworks, and many others. Plangs mission is to provide a one-stop resource not only for languages but also for their tooling and overall ecosystems.

Plangs initial information came from data from Wikipedia and a bit of ChatGPT prompting. However, Wikipedia's notability criteria can be limiting: this means many innovative languages and tools might not be featured there. AI tools are prone to hallucinations, and that's why the idea behind Plangs is to have a curation process backed by human contributors. [Thanks in advance!](/edit) ðŸ˜€.
