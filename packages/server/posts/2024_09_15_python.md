## Type Checking

Python has supported optional type annotations for several years now. While types may seem unnecessary for smaller scripts or projects, they become almost indispensable for large, complex codebases. Type annotations can help identify potential issues early, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

Two prominent type-checking tools for Python are [MyPy](https://mypy-lang.org/) and [PyRight](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) (along with its VSCode extension, [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)).

PyRight's tight integration with VSCode through Pylance makes for a smooth, enjoyable experience and is my preferred way of using type annotations with Python.

## Package Management with Pixi

Python is well known for its messy package management ecosystem. There are many tools available to "solve" this issue, and perhaps that's part of the problem: the paradox of choice. For my projects, I've found that [Pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh) covers all my needs, including:

* Installing Python itself, per project (no need for a global installation).
* Installing dependencies needed by Python packages, like C libraries.
* Installing Python PIP packages.

If you're starting a new project, it's worth giving Pixi.sh a try, especially if you're looking for something faster and lighter than traditional tools like Poetry. Pixi supports Linux, Windows and OS X, is written in rust, and consist of a single executable binary.
