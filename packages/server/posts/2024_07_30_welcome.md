I love programming languages... there's a certain thrill that comes from exploring new programming languages and discovering the unique features of existing ones. Each language offers a fresh perspective and a new set of tools to solve problems in innovative ways.

Plangs aims to create a comprehensive index of programming languages, their implementations, and the tools that make development enjoyable and efficient. Programming languages are not just standalone entities; they define ecosystems filled with compilers, interpreters, libraries, frameworks, and other tools that enhance the development experience. Our goal is to provide a centralized resource where you can find information about all these components.

## Beyond Wikipedia

While Wikipedia has been a valuable resource for information on programming languages, it is often limited by its notability criteria. This means that many interesting and innovative languages and tools might not have a place there.

## Community Contributions

If you are working on a programming language or tool that is not yet listed, we encourage you to open a pull request!

# Thank you for visiting Plangs!
