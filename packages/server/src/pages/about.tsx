        <h2>What is Plangs?</h2>
        <p>
          Plangs is a website dedicated to aggregating and curating information about a wide variety of programming
          languages.
        </p>
        <h2>Community Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          The initial data for Plangs was scraped from Wikipedia infoboxes on programming languages. While Wikipedia
          offers a rich repository of information, not all programming languages have dedicated pages!
        </p>
        <p>
          We manually update the entries for each programming language and tool and gladly accept contributions from
          the community.
        </p>

        <h2>Static Website and Baked Data</h2>
        <p>
          Plangs is built as a static website. All the data on our site is available as a JSON file, following the
          "baked data" pattern inspired by
          <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/28/baked-data/">Simon Willison's Baked Data Pattern</a>.
